# Website Design Recreation

## Workflow

When the user provides a reference image (screenshot) and optionally some CSS classes or style notes:

1. **Generate** a single `index.html` file using Tailwind CSS (via CDN). Include all content inline — no external files unless requested.
2. **Screenshot** the rendered page using Puppeteer (`npx puppeteer screenshot index.html --fullpage` or equivalent). Use a single full-page screenshot at reduced size (e.g. 1280px wide, JPEG) to save tokens. Only capture individual sections when a specific area needs a closer look.
3. **Compare** your screenshot against the reference image. Check for mismatches in:
   - Spacing and padding (measure in px)
   - Font sizes, weights, and line heights
   - Colors (exact hex values)
   - Alignment and positioning
   - Border radii, shadows, and effects
   - Responsive behavior
   - Image/icon sizing and placement
4. **Fix** every mismatch found. Edit the HTML/Tailwind code.
5. **Re-screenshot** and compare again.
6. **Repeat** steps 3–5 at most 2 times in total (2 comparison rounds). Compare only the sections that still differ, not the whole page.

Stop after 2 rounds, or earlier if no visible differences remain. Then summarize any remaining differences and ask the user whether to do another round.

## Technical Defaults

- Use Tailwind CSS via CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`)
- Use placeholder images from `https://placehold.co/` when source images aren't provided
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Single `index.html` file unless the user requests otherwise

## Rules

- Do not add features, sections, or content not present in the reference image
- Match the reference exactly — do not "improve" the design
- If the user provides CSS classes or style tokens, use them verbatim
- Keep code clean but don't over-abstract — inline Tailwind classes are fine
- When comparing screenshots, be specific about what's wrong (e.g., "heading is 32px but reference shows ~24px", "gap between cards is 16px but should be 24px")
